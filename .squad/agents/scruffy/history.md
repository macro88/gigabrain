# Project Context

- **Owner:** macro88
- **Project:** GigaBrain — local-first Rust knowledge brain
- **Stack:** Rust, rusqlite, SQLite FTS5, sqlite-vec, candle + BGE-small-en-v1.5, clap, rmcp
- **Created:** 2026-04-13T14:22:20Z

## Learnings

- The team wants high unit-test coverage, not token test presence.
- Proposal-first work helps define the invariants tests must guard.
- Coverage depth is a first-class role in this squad.

## 2026-04-14T03:59:44Z Scribe Merge (T03 completion)

- Scruffy's T03 markdown test strategy merged into canonical `decisions.md`.
- 20+ must-cover test cases locked before Fry writes parsing logic (prevent re-litigation per-function).
- Test expectations organized by function (parse_frontmatter, split_content, extract_summary, render_page) with 4-5 must-cover cases each.
- Fixture guidance provided: canonical, boundary-trap, no-frontmatter.
- Critical implementation traps documented: HashMap order nondeterminism, trim() fidelity loss, type coercion underspecification, dual `---` roles.
- Orchestration log written. Inbox cleared. Cross-agent histories updated.
