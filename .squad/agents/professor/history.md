- [2026-04-29T20:33:01.970+08:00] Batch 3 vault-sync review: task truth must match operator-facing behavior exactly; if OpenSpec says a live-owner refusal must name pid/host and tell the operator to stop serve first, tests must assert that guidance, not just the error tag.
## 2026-04-29T13:29:11Z — Batch 3 review close

- **Professor:** Rejected Batch 3 on incomplete task closure (`12.6b`/`17.5ii9`). Error text lacks "stop serve first" guidance. Tests incomplete.
- **Nibbler:** Rejected Batch 3 on safety: live-owner guard keyed to `collection_id` (not unique), bulk rewrite lacks offline lease, test coverage insufficient.
- **Mom:** Reassigned to fix both blocking findings. Fry locked out.
- **Scruffy:** Paused validation; coverage lane held pending implementation revisions.
