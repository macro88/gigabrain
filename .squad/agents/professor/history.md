# Project Context

- **Created:** 2026-04-13T14:22:20Z

## Learnings

- Review work should start from the proposal and the accepted project constraints.
- This team expects explicit reviewer gating, not silent approval.
- Maintainability and architectural coherence are key review criteria.

## 2026-04-14 Update

- Fry completed rust-best-practices skill adoption recommendation. Skill recommended for all Rust implementation and review work. Key alignment: error handling split matches our practice, CLI discipline aligns with CI gates, performance constraints match single-binary target.
- MCP evaluation still pending. Coordinator has flagged GitHub MCP as the only currently useful integration for this repo in interim.
- Team memory synchronized: decisions inbox merged into canonical ledger, orchestration logs written, team coordination complete.
- The Rust handbook at `.agents/skills/rust-best-practices/` is adoptable as standing guidance only if rules are classified into defaults vs optional techniques.
- For GigaBrain, strong Rust defaults are borrow-over-clone, `Result` over panic, measured performance work, and justified `#[expect(clippy::...)]` instead of blanket lint suppression.
- GigaBrain is currently a binary crate with internal modules (`src/main.rs`, `src/commands/`, `src/core/`), so library-only rules like blanket `#![deny(missing_docs)]` should stay conditional rather than repo-wide policy.
