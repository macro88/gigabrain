# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

### 2026-04-13: Core intake sources
**By:** macro88 (via Squad)
**What:** Use `docs\spec.md` as the primary product spec, GitHub issues as work intake, and OpenSpec in `openspec\` for structured change proposals and spec evolution.
**Why:** GigaBrain already has a long-form product spec, issue-driven execution, and an initialized OpenSpec workspace. Keeping all three active gives the team a stable source of truth plus a disciplined path for changes.

### 2026-04-13: OpenSpec proposal required before meaningful changes
**By:** macro88 (via Squad)
**What:** Every meaningful code, docs, docs-site, benchmark, or testing change must begin with an OpenSpec change proposal that follows the local instructions in `openspec\`. This proposal step is required in addition to Scribe's logging and decision-merging work.
**Why:** The team needs an explicit design record before implementation, not only an after-the-fact memory trail. This keeps change intent, scope, and review visible before work starts.

### 2026-04-13: Initial squad cast and model policy
**By:** macro88 (via Squad)
**What:** The squad uses a Futurama-inspired cast. Fry and Bender prefer `claude-opus-4.6`; Amy, Hermes, Zapp, and Leela prefer `claude-sonnet-4.6`; Professor, Nibbler, and Scruffy prefer `gpt-5.4`. Kif and Mom are reserved for benchmark and edge-case work with a requested target of `Gemini 3.1 Pro` when that model is available on the active surface.
**Why:** The team is intentionally specialized around implementation, review, documentation, coverage, and performance. Model preferences reflect that specialization while keeping the unavailable Gemini request visible for future surfaces.

### 2026-04-13: Sprint 0 phases, structure, and work sequencing

**By:** Leela

**What:**
GigaBrain is organized into four sequential phases. Phase gates are enforced — no phase begins until the prior phase ships:

| Phase | Name | Gate |
|-------|------|------|
| Sprint 0 | Repository Scaffold | `cargo check` passes; CI triggers on PR; all directories from spec exist |
| Phase 1 | Core Storage, CLI, Search, MCP | Round-trip tests pass; MCP connects; static binary verified |
| Phase 2 | Intelligence Layer | Phase 1 gate passed; graph + OCC + contradiction detection complete |
| Phase 3 | Polish, Benchmarks, Release | All offline CI gates pass; all 8 skills functional; GitHub Releases published |

**Routing:**
- Fry owns Phase 1 implementation (Week 1–4)
- Professor + Nibbler gate Phase 1 before Phase 2 begins
- Bender signs off round-trip tests before Phase 1 ship gate
- Kif establishes BEIR baseline in Phase 3

**Why:** The spec is complete at v4. The team needs a stable execution sequence with clear gates so parallel work (implementation, tests, docs, review) stays coordinated. Front-loading the scaffold removes ambiguity for Fry before the first line of implementation code is written.

### 2026-04-13: Fry Sprint 0 revision — addressing Nibbler blockers

**By:** Fry

**What:**
Applied targeted fixes to Sprint 0 artifacts so the scaffold is internally coherent and proposals match actual CI behavior:

1. **Cargo.toml + src/main.rs coherence** — Added `env` feature to `clap`; replaced `~/brain.db` default with platform-safe `default_db_path()` function.
2. **CI / proposal alignment** — Removed musl/static-link gates from CI, moved to release-only. CI now matches proposal: `cargo fmt` + `cargo clippy` + `cargo check` + `cargo test`.
3. **release.yml hardening** — Fixed tag trigger glob pattern; pinned `cross` to version 0.2.5.
4. **Phase 1 OCC semantics** — Added explicit "Concurrency: Optimistic Concurrency Control" section with compare-and-swap, version bump, and MCP contract definition.
5. **knowledge_gaps privacy** — Replaced raw `query_text` with `query_hash` + conditional store; schema-default is privacy-safe.

**Why:** Closes gaps identified by Nibbler's adversarial review, ensuring scaffold passes its documented gate and all proposals internally cohere. No implementation logic added beyond minimum for platform safety.

### 2026-04-14: Adopt rust-best-practices skill as standing Rust guidance

**By:** Fry (recommended), macro88 (accepted)

**What:** Adopt the `rust-best-practices` skill (Apollo GraphQL public handbook, 9 chapters) as standing guidance for all Rust implementation and review work in this repo. Key chapters: borrowing vs cloning, clippy discipline, performance mindset, error handling, testing, generics, type-state, documentation, concurrency.

**Caveats:**
- `#[expect(...)]` requires MSRV ≥1.81; verify before enforcing (current `Cargo.toml` specifies `edition = "2021"` without explicit MSRV)
- `rustfmt.toml` import reordering (`group_imports = "StdExternalCrate"`) needs nightly; don't add until stable supports it or CI has a nightly-fmt step
- Snapshot testing (`insta`) recommended but defer to Phase 1 testing work, not before
- `Cow<'_, T>` useful in parsing but don't over-apply; prefer `&str`/`String` initially, refactor only if profiling shows benefit
- Dynamic dispatch and type-state pattern: overkill for current scope; revisit if plugin architecture or multi-step builder API emerges

**Why:** The skill directly aligns with GigaBrain's existing practices: error handling split (`thiserror` for `src/core/`, `anyhow` for CLI/main), CI discipline (`cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`), and performance constraints (single static binary, lean embedding/search pipeline). Provides consistent vocabulary for code review and implementation guidance.

**Decision:** Adopted. All agents writing or reviewing Rust should reference the SKILL.md quick reference before starting work.

### 2026-04-14: User directive — review Rust workspace skill and use consistently

**By:** macro88 (via Copilot)

**What:** Review the Rust-specific skill in the workspace and, if it is good, use it consistently when building Rust in this project.

**Why:** User request — captured for team memory. (Fry reviewed and recommended adoption — see above decision.)

### 2026-04-13: User directive — branch + PR workflow

**By:** macro88 (via Copilot)

**What:** Never commit directly to `main`. Always work from a branch, open a PR, link the PR to the relevant GitHub issue, and include the relevant OpenSpec proposal/change.

**Why:** User request — ensuring team memory captures governance requirement.

## Governance

- All meaningful changes require team consensus
- Document architectural decisions here
- Keep history focused on work, decisions focused on direction
- OpenSpec proposals are created before implementation; decisions.md records accepted direction and lasting team rules
- Never commit directly to `main`; all changes flow through branch → PR → review → merge
