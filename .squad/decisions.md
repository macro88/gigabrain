# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

### 2026-04-13: Core intake sources
**By:** macro88 (via Squad)
**What:** Use `docs\spec.md` as the primary product spec, GitHub issues as work intake, and OpenSpec in `openspec\` for structured change proposals and spec evolution.
**Why:** GigaBrain already has a long-form product spec, issue-driven execution, and an initialized OpenSpec workspace. Keeping all three active gives the team a stable source of truth plus a disciplined path for changes.

### 2026-04-13: OpenSpec proposal required before meaningful changes
**By:** macro88 (via Squad)
**What:** Every meaningful code, docs, docs-site, benchmark, or testing change must begin with an OpenSpec change proposal that follows the local instructions in `openspec\`. This proposal step is required in addition to Scribe's logging and decision-merging work.
**Why:** The team needs an explicit design record before implementation, not only an after-the-fact memory trail. This keeps change intent, scope, and review visible before work starts.

### 2026-04-13: Initial squad cast and model policy
**By:** macro88 (via Squad)
**What:** The squad uses a Futurama-inspired cast. Fry and Bender prefer `claude-opus-4.6`; Amy, Hermes, Zapp, and Leela prefer `claude-sonnet-4.6`; Professor, Nibbler, and Scruffy prefer `gpt-5.4`. Kif and Mom are reserved for benchmark and edge-case work with a requested target of `Gemini 3.1 Pro` when that model is available on the active surface.
**Why:** The team is intentionally specialized around implementation, review, documentation, coverage, and performance. Model preferences reflect that specialization while keeping the unavailable Gemini request visible for future surfaces.

## Governance

- All meaningful changes require team consensus
- Document architectural decisions here
- Keep history focused on work, decisions focused on direction
- OpenSpec proposals are created before implementation; decisions.md records accepted direction and lasting team rules
