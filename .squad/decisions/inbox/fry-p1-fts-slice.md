# Decision: T13 FTS5 Search Implementation

**Author:** Fry
**Date:** 2026-04-14
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED
**Scope:** `src/core/fts.rs`, `src/core/types.rs`, `src/commands/search.rs`

## Context

T13 requires FTS5 full-text search over the `page_fts` virtual table, BM25-ranked,
with optional wing filtering.

## Decisions

1. **`SearchError` added to types.rs.** The T01 spec listed `SearchError` but it was
   not yet defined. Added with two variants: `Sqlite` (from rusqlite) and `Internal`
   (general message). This keeps the same thiserror pattern as `DbError` and `OccError`.

2. **BM25 score negation.** SQLite's `bm25()` returns negative values where more
   negative = more relevant. We negate the score (`-bm25(page_fts)`) so the
   `SearchResult.score` field is positive-higher-is-better, which is the natural
   convention for downstream consumers. Sort order uses raw `bm25()` ascending.

3. **Empty/whitespace query short-circuit.** Rather than passing an empty string to
   FTS5 MATCH (which would error), `search_fts` returns an empty vec immediately.
   This is a defensive guard, not a spec requirement.

4. **`commands/search.rs` wired minimally.** The search command now calls `search_fts`
   directly and applies `--limit` via `Iterator::take`. No hybrid search plumbing —
   that's T16/T17 scope.

5. **Dynamic SQL for wing filter.** Same pattern as `list.rs` — build SQL string with
   optional `AND p.wing = ?2` clause and boxed params. Avoids separate prepared
   statements per filter combination.

## Test coverage

10 new unit tests in `core::fts::tests`:
- Empty DB, empty query, whitespace query
- Content keyword match, title keyword match, absent term
- Wing filter inclusion/exclusion
- BM25 ranking order
- Result struct field correctness

Total test count: 86 → 96 (all passing).

## Impact on other agents

- **T16 (hybrid search):** Can now import `search_fts` as one fan-out leg.
- **T17 (search command):** Already wired — just needs hybrid_search swap when T16 lands.
- **Bender:** `SearchError` is available for integration test assertions.
